# JetsonTX2Blender
This is blender for the jetson tx2 which may or may not work. If you would like to contribute feel free to just clone the repo.

This is a project which means it probably doesent work and if it does not in a usable state so if you are going to report an issue please check to see if it hasent already been reported.

P.S Also yes I know you can just run sudo apt install blender on a tx2 and theres blender but thats on cpu rendering the goal here is to get it to gpu render with cuda and to be completly automated rendering
